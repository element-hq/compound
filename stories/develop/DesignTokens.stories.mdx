# Design Tokens

Compound uses design tokens. They are kept in sync between Figma and code bases
using [tokens.studio](https://tokens.studio/) and a the [vector-im/compound-design-tokens](https://github.com/vector-im/compound-design-tokens) repository as a
data source.

Tokens are transformed using [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/)
for [Android](https://github.com/vector-im/compound-design-tokens/tree/develop/assets/android),
[iOS](https://github.com/vector-im/compound-design-tokens/tree/develop/assets/ios/swift) and [Web](https://github.com/vector-im/compound-design-tokens/tree/develop/assets/web) to consume.
