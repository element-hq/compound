# Getting started as a designer

Available styles can be found in the [Compound Styles Figma document](https://www.figma.com/file/PpKepmHKGikp33Ql7iivbn/Compound-Styles?node-id=22%3A2763&t=UAtRgYRpQ2xofvM3-1).
They are generated from our set of design tokens.

Themes can be switched using the [Themer Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/731176732337510831/Themer).

In order to use Themer, you will need to provide the following data in its Settings tab:

- API Key
- URL to your JSONBin

Please find the expected values in Passbolt (Element employees only).

Need more help? Watch a quick [video tutorial on how to setup Themer]([url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOPZ2oGdQFo)).

# Getting started as a design system maintainer

As a design system maintainer you will need to follow the same steps as designers.
But you will also need to configure the [tokens.studio Figma plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978)
that is used to manage design tokens.

## tokens.studio GitHub sync

The design tokens are stored in [vector-im/compound-design-tokens](https://github.com/vector-im/compound-design-tokens)
and this plugin offers a synchronisation feature with GitHub, [follow these steps to configure it](https://docs.tokens.studio/sync/github).
