# Marketing

While the primary goal with Compound is to improve core product design, it can also be used to improve brand consistency across our website, online marketing and print. To do this productively, Compound can help with:

* **Colour:** Use the Compound colour scale to promote consistency. Default to the semantic palette to ensure sufficient text contrast for web accessibility.   
* **Typography:** Use Compound Web typography styles as a baseline for body content on [element.io](https://www.element.io), again for web accessibility.
* **Iconography:** Use Compound iconography to promote consistency in and out of app.

Otherwise, extend with marketing specific styles and assets in the Compound Marketing shared Figma library.
