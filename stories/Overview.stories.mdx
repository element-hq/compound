# Compound

Compound is the work-in-progress design system for Element. If you're new to Compound - here's a 101 overview of everything you need to know.

## What's Compound?

Compound is the design system for Element. It's a shared language and set of UI component implementations for the web, iOS & Android. Compound is broken down into the following primitives:

- Foundations: Guiding principles which inform the basis of any implementation.
- Styles: Systems for applying colour, type, spacing, sizing and materials.
- Components: Defined components used to build end user experiences.

## Platforms

The first target platforms for Compound are:

- ElementX, iOS & Android
- Element Web
- Element Call
- Element Admin
- Authentication screens when authenticating using OIDC

Find the latest status on [the roadmap and board](https://github.com/orgs/vector-im/projects/52/views/16) (will be publicly accessible when the design system matures further).

## Using Compound

Compound is primarily built for and maintained by the Element core team. The code is open and available for anyone to use.

If you're on the core team, start using Compound to:

- Design: Set up Figma with shared libraries and plugins (core team only). Start designing using styles and components.
- Develop: Familiarise yourself with packages and workflows.

## Contributing

Currently, we're working closely with the core teams building the target platforms listed above. If you're on those teams - the best way to contribute is with your feedback [in the internal room](https://matrix.to/#/#compound:matrix.org) as we implement packages, styles and components.
