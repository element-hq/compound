# Voice & Tone

### _Content isn’t written, it’s designed._

Let's take a closer look at writing content for users in general, regardless of the audience or context:

- [What is voice and tone?](#voice-and-tone)
- [Content isn't _just_ copy](#content-isnt-just-copy)
- [People don't read](#people-dont-read)

## <a id="voice-and-tone"></a> What is voice and tone?

Voice and Tone informs both what we say and how we say it. Together, they create our brand voice, which defines our style, personality, and point of view.

These content guidelines provide an understanding of our brand voice to all employees; ensuring that, when speaking as Element, customers recognise us quickly and know what to expect.

### Our voice

Regardless of the format, channel, subject matter, or particular context, what we say should always reflect our core values and feel consistent.

In practice, this means a few things. First and foremost, any content should be:

* **Honest:** Whenever we write anything for anyone, in any context, the user/reader should be able to trust Element.

* **Clear:** The user should alway feel informed and in control whenever their privacy or security is at risk, there’s an issue, or if there’s something important they need to do.

* **Respectful:**  Users will have different levels of understanding when it comes to technology. Therefore, the language and terminology used must be simple enough for anyone to understand.

* **Positive:** No matter what they’re trying to do on Element, the user should feel good (or at least confident) about doing it.

### Our tone

When it comes to how we say things, that depends entirely on the context.

* #### **On our website or in our marketing channels:**

    * Since the reader is actively seeking out more information about Element, we can show more personality and take a more creative approach with the language we use. We can also spend more time educating the reader since their motivation to learn is higher than a typical end-user.

    * The biggest consideration will be whether the content is written for a general or commercial audience.

        * A general audience (end-users) will expect a friendly, informal, and positive tone — with a dash of flare.

        * A commercial audience (clients) will expect a neutral, professional, and straightforward tone – perhaps with some industry jargon.

        * A technical audience (admins) will expect zero flare, technical precision, and lots of jargon.

* #### **In our apps:**

    * Since the reader is also currently using Element, the content should try to get out of their way as much as possible. There should be as few words as possible, and all of them should be immediately understandable.

    * When brevity matters, our “tone” should reflect the fact that the user just wants to complete a task or get back to their conversations, not think more about the app itself or why it’s cool.

    * So, when writing content for our apps:

        * Keep it short
        * Make it action-oriented
        * Focus on the benefits to the user
        * Don’t raise unnecessary alarm
        * Never assign blame (either to the user, the client, or Element)

    * Then, depending on the situation, the tone can be:

        * Straightforward
        * Neutral
        * Informative
        * Helpful

* #### **For our admin tools:**

    * Since the reader is also an administrator of Element across a large organisation, jargon and technical language are appreciated instead of off-putting, especially when describing exactly how to do something.

    * However, admins are people too—not robots performing tasks. Content should therefore always feel like it’s written by humans for humans (who are also helping other humans).

## <a id="content-isnt-just-copy"></a> Content isn’t _just_ copy

In the same way that 80% of communication between humans is non-verbal, the same applies to content. There’s more to content than copy, and sometimes the best way to communicate something isn't through the written word at all; it might be better represented through graphics, video, audio, or something else entirely. It’s telling the story that’s important and, whichever is the chosen medium, all Element content needs to adhere to our voice and tone guidelines.

### **Examples**

<table>

  <tr>
   <td>

   </td>
   <td><h4>Illustration on homepage</h4>
<p>
A simple illustrations shows that enterprise customers can use Element to communicate with outside partners, no matter what platform they use.
<p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><h4>Verification request</h4>
<p>
Since they’re the one initiating the request (hopefully), the user just needs to read the question and click a big black button. An icon and basic information are visible to confirm that it’s the actual device they’re trying to verify.
<p>
   </td>
   <td>

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>

   </td>
   <td><h4>Scanning a QR code</h4> 
<p>
“Scan QR code”, a camera icon, and giant target area highlighted in green are all the cues most users will need to understand that they need to scan a QR code now.
<p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><h4>Device verification successful</h4>
<p>
The user doesn’t have to read the content to understand that the action was successful and that their new device is secure.
<p>
   </td>
   <td>

(image)

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>

(image)

   </td>
   <td><h4>No internet connection banner</h4>
<p>
An icon and brief message are all that’s necessary to communicate a loss of connection, and the user should be able to infer that new messages can’t be sent or received until their connection has been restored.
<p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><h4>Sign out of Element Admin Console</h4
<p>
The sign out button is in red because this could be a destructive action if the admin has made any unsaved updates.
<p>
   </td>
   <td>

(image)

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>

(image)

   </td>
   <td><h4>New message</h4>
<p>
A brief sound is used to indicated a new incoming message, and a bubble containing a number shows the number of unread messages in the room list.
<p>

## <a id="people-dont-read"></a> People don’t read

In the UK nearly [15%](https://literacytrust.org.uk/parents-and-families/adult-literacy/what-do-adult-literacy-levels-mean/#:~:text=This%20survey%20found%20that%2016.4,different%20ways%2C%20as%20outlined%20below.) of the adult population have a literacy skill lower than that expected of a 9 year old. Therefore, we should always be conscious of the way we write and the reading capabilities of our users. Whenever writing content, the [Flesch–Kincaid scale](https://readable.com/readability/flesch-reading-ease-flesch-kincaid-grade-level/) is a good place to start, with Grade 5 as the benchmark. (Pro tip: Check out [this tool](https://hemingwayapp.com/) to see the reading age of whatever you’re writing.)

However, even if a user can read well, that doesn’t mean that they’ll actually read all the words written. In fact, [only 16% will read things words by word](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/). Everyone else scans and picks out individual words or phrases. This is called a [reading saccade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_in_reading).

So whenever writing, especially for our apps, make sure that the content is scannable by using:

* Keywords in headlines
* Short, meaningful sub-headlines
* One idea per paragraph for longer text
* Bulleted lists
* Less words overall
