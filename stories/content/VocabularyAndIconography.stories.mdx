# Vocabulary & Iconography

## Common terms and their meaning

The actual words we use to describe specific features, processes, or other attributes of Element matters a lot since an unfamiliar term (or inconsistent use of a term) can easily confuse users. This is why we aim to call things exactly what they are, using common language, instead of inventing Element-specific terminology the user must learn.

Below is a list of the most common terms or concepts the average user will come across when using Element. While additional explanations may be necessary on occasion, depending on context, the word(s) we use to identify each individual thing or idea should never change.

  <tr>
    <td>
      General
    </td>
    <td><strong>Element</strong></td>
    <td>
      Element is an app that individual people, professional organisations,
      governments, and communities use to communicate securely, powered by
      Matrix.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td><strong>Matrix</strong></td>
    <td>
      Matrix is an open network for secure, decentralised communication. The
      official specification for Matrix is maintained by the Matrix.org
      Foundation, a non-profit organisation based in the UK.

  <tr>
    <td>
      Registration
    </td>
    <td><strong>Account provider</strong></td>
    <td>
      This is where your conversations will live — just like you would use an
      email provider to keep your emails.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td><strong>Account</strong></td>
    <td>
      This is where information about your identity is securely stored, such as
      your username and email, which is managed separately from the Element app.
      You can connect your account to any service that supports Matrix ID.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td><strong>Password</strong></td>
    <td>
      A secret code or phrase that proves it’s you before giving you access to
      your account.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td><strong>Username</strong></td>
    <td>Your official name on Element, which can't be changed later.</td>

    <td></td>
    <td><strong>Matrix ID</strong></td>
    <td>
      This is your full identity, which others can use to find you (eg:
      @username:matrix.org). "Matrix ID" refers to Matrix, the open network
      which powers Element, allowing people to communicate and collaborate
      securely. Element, or any other service provider, doesn't own your
      conversations – you do.

    <td><strong>Enter recovery key</strong></td>
    <td>
      If you're signed out of Element everywhere, use a recovery key to set up

    <td><strong>Encryption keys</strong></td>
    <td>
      These are used to encrypt the messages you send, or decrypt messages which
      you receive from others, so that nobody else but you and the reciptiant(s)
      can see your conversation. Your encryption keys are created the first time
      you use Element and stored locally on your computer or mobile device,
      separately from your account.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td><strong>Secure backup</strong></td>
    <td>
      Securely store your encryption keys in the cloud. This allows you to set
      up secure messaging after signing into another device with a QR code or by
      comparing a 6-digit number. Otherwise, you'll need a recovery code to
      restore your encryption keys, which are needed to read or send secure
      messages.

## Common icons and their meaning

Icons can be a way to communicate lots of information at a glance. For example, instead of a button that says “Call this user”, we simply show a phone icon.

However, there are challenges to using icons. For example, how one person perceives the meaning of an icon might differ from another user. Or worse, the icon itself _can_ mean multiple things, in which case confusion is guaranteed.

#### **To limit confusion and maximise comprehension…**

- Don’t mix metaphors by using one icon for multiple things, or complicate things by creating compound metaphors.

- Use icons or visuals that are universally understood whenever possible – especially unlabeled icons

- Limit the use of icons overall so that the interface doesn’t become cluttered or “noisy”
