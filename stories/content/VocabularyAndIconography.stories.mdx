# Vocabulary & Iconography

## Common terms and their meaning

The actual words we use to describe specific features, processes, or other attributes of Element matters a lot since an unfamiliar term (or inconsistent use of a term) can easily confuse users. This is why we aim to call things exactly what they are, using common language, instead of inventing Element-specific terminology the user must learn.

Below is a list of the most common terms or concepts the average user will come across when using Element. While additional explanations may be necessary on occasion, depending on context, the word(s) we use to identify each individual thing or idea should never change.

### Glossary

| Category     | Name or label            | User-friendly description                                                                                                                                                                       |

| General              | **Element**              | Element is an app that individual people, professional organisations, governments, and communities use to communicate securely, powered by Matrix.                                              
|                      | **Matrix**               | Matrix is an open network for secure, decentralised communication. The official specification for Matrix is maintained by the Matrix.org Foundation, a non-profit organisation based in the UK. 
| Registration         | **Account provider**     | This is where your conversations will live — just like you would use an email provider to keep your emails.
|                      | **Account**              | This is where information about your identity is securely stored, such as your username and email, which is managed separately from the Element app. You can connect your account to any service that supports Matrix ID.
|                      | **Password**             | A secret code or phrase that proves it’s you before giving you access to your account.
|                      | **Username**             | Your official name on Element, which can't be changed later.
|                      | **Matrix ID**            | This is your full identity, which others can use to find you (eg: @username:matrix.org). "Matrix ID" refers to Matrix, the open network which powers Element, allowing people to communicate and collaborate securely. Element, or any other service provider, doesn't own your conversations – you do.
|                      | **Display name**         | The name shown next to your avatar, which other people will see in their timeline. This can be changed anytime.
| Sign in              | **Verify device**        | Confirm that it's you to set up secure messaging when signing into a new device for the first time.
|                      | **Scan QR code**         | Automatically sign in, set up secure messaging for a device, or verify someone's identity by scanning a QR code.
|                      | **Compare 6-digit code** | The name shown next to your avatar, which other people will see in their timeline. This can be changed anytime.
|                      | **Enter recovery key**   | If you're signed out of Element everywhere, use a recovery key to set up secure messaging on a new device after signing back in. This is separate from your account password.
| Messaging            | **Chat**                 | Any conversation on Element.
|                      | **Direct message**       | A conversation between you and one other person. Nobody else can join.
|                      | **Room**                 | A conversation between three or more people, either private or public.
|                      | **Secure messaging**     | Messages are end-to-end encrypted and can only be sent or read by people in this room.
|                      | **Not encrypted**        | Someone outside this room may be able to intercept and read any messages.
| Verification & Trust | **Verify user**          | Confirm the identity of another user by sharing a QR code or comparing a string of numbers.
|                      | **Trusted person**       | Anyone you’ve confirmed as the actual owner of an account.
|                      | **Trusted device**       | You've set up secure messaging after signing in to Element, so other users can also trust your device.
|                      | **Device**               | Anywhere you're signed in to Element.
|                      | **Encryption keys**      | These are used to encrypt the messages you send, or decrypt messages which you receive from others, so that nobody else but you and the reciptiant(s) can see your conversation. Your encryption keys are created the first time you use Element and stored locally on your computer or mobile device, separately from your account.
|                      | **Secure backup**      | Securely store your encryption keys in the cloud. This allows you to set up secure messaging after signing into another device with a QR code or by comparing a 6-digit number. Otherwise, you'll need a recovery code to restore your encryption keys, which are needed to read or send secure messages.

## Common icons and their meaning

Icons can be a way to communicate lots of information at a glance. For example, instead of a button that says “Call this user”, we simply show a phone icon.

However, there are challenges to using icons. For example, how one person perceives the meaning of an icon might differ from another user. Or worse, the icon itself _can_ mean multiple things, in which case confusion is guaranteed.

#### **To limit confusion and maximise comprehension…**

- Don’t mix metaphors by using one icon for multiple things, or complicate things by creating compound metaphors.

- Use icons or visuals that are universally understood whenever possible – especially unlabeled icons

- Limit the use of icons overall so that the interface doesn’t become cluttered or “noisy”
