# Vocabulary & Iconography

## Common terms and their meaning

The actual words we use to describe specific features, processes, or other attributes of Element matters a lot since an unfamiliar term (or inconsistent use of a term) can easily confuse users. This is why we aim to call things exactly what they are, using common language, instead of inventing Element-specific terminology the user must learn.

Below is a list of the most common terms or concepts the average user will come across when using Element. While additional explanations may be necessary on occasion, depending on context, the word(s) we use to identify each individual thing or idea should never change.

## Common icons and their meaning

Icons can be a way to communicate lots of information at a glance. For example, instead of a button that says “Call this user”, we simply show a phone icon.

However, there are challenges to using icons. For example, how one person perceives the meaning of an icon might differ from another user. Or worse, the icon itself _can_ mean multiple things, in which case confusion is guaranteed.

#### **To limit confusion and maximise comprehension…**


* Don’t mix metaphors by using one icon for multiple things, or complicate things by creating compound metaphors.

* Use icons or visuals that are universally understood whenever possible – especially unlabeled icons

* Limit the use of icons overall so that the interface doesn’t become cluttered or “noisy”
