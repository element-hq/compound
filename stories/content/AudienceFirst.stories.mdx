### _Target audiences and personas_

Good content doesn’t just effectively communicate information, it also speaks directly to a particular audience. In our case, there are several different audiences who use Element to communicate securely, and the app should “speak” to all of them using language that’s familiar and contextual to their situation.

Let’s take a look at these audiences and how they differ from each other:

- [Enterprise users](#enterprise-users)
- [Community users](#community-users)
- [Personal users](#personal-users)
- [IT Administrators](#admins)

---

## <a id="enterprise-users"></a> Enterprise users

The #1 audience we need to keep in mind are those who use Element for work. “Work” could be at any professional organisation, whether it’s a company, educational institution, or government agency. While some organisations allow or even encourage their workforce to choose their preferred messaging service, many enterprise users are compelled to use Element as their sole, official communication tool. Therefore, Element needs to be just as powerful and easy to use as other popular workplace communication tools.

- **Benchmarks:** They’re usually familiar with other professional messaging apps like Slack and MS Teams, and probably expect a similar experience on Element.

- **Awareness:** Even though their organisation has chosen Element specifically because of its security features and network management capabilities, most enterprise users will have never heard of “Element” before, and almost nobody will have any idea what “Matrix” is.

- **Motivation:** Therefore, end-users may not personally care about things like our mission or the extra security Element provides — they just want to be able to communicate with their colleagues effectively, without problems or critical limitations.

- **Situation:**

  - Technical knowledge will of course depend on role and personal experience, but nearly everyone in a professional working environment will be at least somewhat more comfortable with technology than the average user.

  - Still, many new users won’t be familiar with the extra security procedures required to set up secure messaging on Element, and there might be additional rules or protocols they must follow when communicating with other people after signing in.

  - Those who work in highly-secure environments, such as for a government agency, will need to take even extra steps to keep their conversations safe.

  - Finally, there’s often significantly more risk or harm caused if things go wrong, either for the user or the organisation they work for.

  - When errors or problems do arise, there’s usually an IT Administrator who can offer guidance or intervention if necessary. Therefore, they aren't likely to come to us directly for help or read the documentation we provide.

## <a id="community-users"></a> **Community users**

The second most important audience are those who use Element to participate in or facilitate a community. In addition to connecting with other members (which could be in the hundreds or thousands), they’re also coordinating events and activities—whether online or in person. This adds another layer of complexity beyond direct messaging or chatting with people in smaller groups.

- **Benchmarks:** Most members of a community on Element use WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook, and/or other popular messaging apps in their daily life. But some will also have used other community-friendly apps in the past, such as MeetUp, Discord, Slack, IRC or Reddit.

- **Awareness:** Users who are invited to join a community on Element may have no idea what “Element” is, but they might be familiar with Matrix. However, those managing a community usually choose Element over other more popular alternatives for specific reasons, such as privacy concerns.

- **Motivation:** Many users appreciate things like the extra security and open network that Element provides, but most users will still care most about communicating with or managing their community successfully.

- **Situation:**

  - The technical knowledge of general community users will vary from one to another. But those who are running a community may have a deeper understanding of technology if they’ve managed an online community in the past.

  - In any case, most new users won’t be familiar with the extra security procedures required to set up secure messaging on Element, and those running a community will need to learn how to manage the security of rooms and moderate conversations effectively.

  - The average community user may assume that any conversation is “safe”, but those managing a community will want to know definitively whether the conversations in a particular room are secure.

  - If a general community user encounters a problem they can often reach out to an administrator. However, an admin won’t have anybody to help them—they’ll need to figure out how to solve any issues on their own.

## <a id="personal-users"></a> **Personal users**

Another important audience are people using Element to communicate with friends and family. These users often use Element because they care about their privacy, want a secure alternative to other popular messaging apps, are an advocate of open-source technology, or simply because somebody encouraged them to join. In any case, if something goes wrong or doesn’t work the way they expected, they can alway just choose a differe nt messaging app.

- **Benchmarks:** Most personal users of Element are mobile-first and expect any messaging app to work just like WhatsApp and Telegram, or at least it should be just as easy to use.

- **Awareness:** Some personal users are invited to join Element directly through a friend or family member. But a lot of times people choose Element over other messaging apps for a specific reason. In other words, nobody uses Element simply because it was the first app suggested by Google Play or the App Store.

- **Motivation:** Although they may sometimes be more knowledgeable about things like security than the average user, a personal user of Element will always care first and foremost about communicating with their social network easily.

- **Situation:**

  - Technical knowledge will vary from non-technical users with little or no understanding of technology at all, to those who write code for work and read about cryptography topics for fun.

  - Regardless, the vast majority of new users won’t be familiar with the extra security procedures required to set up secure messaging on Element (or fully understand why the app works differently than other messaging apps in the first place).

  - Because they’re communicating over an open network, it may be important for them to know whether their conversations are secure (ie. encrypted) when joining a room depending on how or why they're using Element. Otherwise, the majority of users will automatically assume that any conversation is “safe”.

  - They have to solve any errors or problems on their own.

## <a id="admins"></a> **IT administrators (“admins”)**

The final audience we care for are the admins who set up and maintain Element for a large professional organisation. Sometimes there are several admins who manage the organisation, while other times there might be just one person. In any case, there usually aren’t many of them. This means that admins are often busy trying to resolve issues on the fly and under pressure — especially if it involves new hires.

- **Benchmarks:** The tools admins use to set up or maintain large communication networks are notoriously complex and usually don’t provide a simple, user-friendly experience. In many cases, the admin will use terminals, online repositories, project management apps, or other technical interfaces just to complete a basic task. Many times there’s little consistency between one tool or another.

- **Awareness:** Admins will know about Element and have at least some knowledge of Matrix. They may have even advocated for Element when choosing a communications platform for their organisation.

- **Motivation:** The job of an admin is to ensure that everything is running smoothly and securely. In other words, they’re highly motivated to understand every nuance of Element deeply, whether it’s the technology that powers it, or the features and settings available to any end user.

- **Situation:**

  - Any admin will have a deep understanding of technology in general, and security specifically, but they probably need to learn more about the particulars of setting up secure messaging on Element for hundreds or thousands of employees.

  - The average admin understands that there’s no such thing as 100% “safe”. In addition to making sure that everything runs smoothly, their role is to minimise the security risks of any sensitive conversations taking place on Element.

  - Whenever configuring Element or managing the server(s) that power the network, admins _must_ know whether or not any action is irreversible or destructive since there’s significant risk involved if they do something wrong.

  - The admin is the one resolving issues for users of Element at their organisation. If they run into a problem they haven’t encountered before, they can consult their peers (if they don’t work alone) or the Element Client Service team (if they have a contractual relationship with us). At the very least they’ll have technical documentation to consult.
