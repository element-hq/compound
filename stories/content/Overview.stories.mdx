Writing for our website and marketing channels is one thing. Writing for our apps and admin tools is quite another. The former is all about selling our products to specific audiences, in which Element is the hero. Whereas the latter is all about helping users accomplish their goal, in which _they_ are the hero.

These guidelines are primarily for Product Designers or Developers who are writing for our marketing channels, Element apps, or admin tools, but they can also be used by anyone whoâ€™s developing content.

For general guidance, you can also check out the Element Brand Guidelines Figma document to learn more about our overall messaging strategy, brand campaign, unique sell propositions, and design assets.
