# Goals & Principles

Many of us who work at Element, and a sizeable chunk of the users we serve, are highly technical people. We deeply understand the complexity of building secure communication tools on a decentralised network—including what things are called and how they work. The problem is that when technical people build software, we often forget one crucial fact:

> ### _Most users don’t understand the technical stuff, and they shouldn’t have to in order to use Element._

They just want to know that things are working properly. Or, if there’s a problem, they want to know how to fix it as quickly as possible. Otherwise, the tool should get out of their way and let them focus on what’s actually important: communicating with people. That’s a reasonable expectation in a world filled with suitable, familiar alternatives.

So how do we design software that serves both the technically-minded experts and untechnical novices? We start with some guiding principles that can help us make better decisions about any new feature, content, or flow:

### 1. The user should always feel calm and in control

They should never feel worried, anxious, confused, uncertain, stupid, or unable to complete an intended action.

### 2. The user should be able to _assume_ safety and security unless indicated otherwise

Get out of the user’s way whenever possible, and don’t constantly bombard them with contextual information that may confuse or unnecessarily alarm them.

### 3. Icons and terms should only represent one concept or thing

The ideal icon is both self-evident to the user and easy to remember. Any term should be self-explanatory and use common language, unless it’s absolutely necessary to be technical.

### 4. Be consistent

Use the same terminology to label or describe something no matter where it’s shown in the user interface (UI), especially when communicating about security topics or specific features.
