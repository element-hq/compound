## The interface should…

- **Get out of the way whenever possible.** Let the user focus on the content, not the interface.

- **Use colour sparingly, but consistently**

  - **Green** = Confirmed, success, verified, enabled ONLY

  - **Red** = Problem, error, destructive actions ONLY

  - **Other** = Important high-level information and key moments ONLY (ex. avatars, content, illustrations)

  - **Black**, **White**, **Grey** = Everything else

  - **However, don’t rely on colour alone to convey information** due to colour blindness, accessibility needs, or night-vision support (NVIS)

- **Present novel or important information prominently and clearly.** Not everything is important. But if something is truly important, use colour, size, spacing, or other visual cues to draw attention to just that one thing.

- **Allow for progressive disclosure.**

      * **1st level = Minimal info** \
      By default, the interface should be simple, uncluttered, and clear as to what’s interactive and what isn’t.

      * **2nd level = Statuses & high level info** \

  On rollover, on-click, or at-a-glance, any information provided should be brief, easy to understand, and clearly describe the benefit or action needed.\*\*

      * **3rd level = More details, technical information & granular controls** \

  One can safely assume that if a user actively digs for more information, then they really want to know the details. So give them all the details, but without alienating (or worrying) non-technical users.

- **Make it absolutely clear when to take action, and how.** Clearly differentiate between FYI things and things that require urgent action. For example…

  - **If there is an actual, immediate problem,**

    - Use red and/or negative icons.

    - ALWAYS provide an actionable way to resolve the issue. After all, if the app could make a decision by itself, there would be no need to display a message or error!

  - **If there _could_ be a problem,** even theoretically,

    - Use neutral colours and icons.

    - For things that _can’t_ be acted upon, at least provide a link to learn more technical details and/or educational content wherever possible.

    - For things that _can_ be acted upon, provide a way to take action without alarming the user or making them feel like they _have_ to do something.

## UI content should…

- **Be written in plain language that anyone can understand.**

  - 1st and 2nd level content especially should pass the “my parents would understand this” test.

  - 3rd level content should at least be understandable at a high-level to any user.

  - Use as few words as possible to describe the “bottom line”.

  - Content that requires more explanation should be scannable:

    - Headlines/categories/labels should be able to stand on its own

    - Supporting copy should be brief and focus on the primary benefit or action needed

    - CTAs should be be proportionate to the importance/urgency of possible actions

  - Whenever writing content, the [Flesch–Kincaid scale](https://readable.com/readability/flesch-reading-ease-flesch-kincaid-grade-level/) is a good place to start, with Grade 5 as the benchmark.

    - **Pro tip:** Check out [this tool](https://hemingwayapp.com/) to see the reading age of whatever you’re writing

    - **When it comes to translations**, ALWAYS ask a native speaker to translate the content instead of relying on Google Translate :)

- **Avoid getting in the way of user generated content.**

  - Don’t decorate messages with erroneous or repetitive information.

  - Consider the size of text content in relation to the overall interface or timeline content.
