# **Writing for Apps**


## The interface should…

* **Get out of the way whenever possible.** Let the user focus on the content, not the interface.

* **Use colour sparingly, but consistently**

    * **Green** = Confirmed, success, verified, enabled ONLY

    * **Red** = Problem, error, destructive actions ONLY

    * **Other** = Important high-level information and key moments ONLY (ex. avatars, content, illustrations)

    * **Black**, **White**, **Grey** = Everything else

    * **However, don’t rely on colour alone to convey information** due to colour blindness, accessibility needs, or night-vision support (NVIS)

* **Present novel or important information prominently and clearly.** Not everything is important. But if something is truly important, use colour, size, spacing, or other visual cues to draw attention to just that one thing.

* **Allow for progressive disclosure.**

    * **1st level = Minimal info** \
    By default, the interface should be simple, uncluttered, and clear as to what’s interactive and what isn’t.

    * **2nd level = Statuses & high level info** \
On rollover, on-click, or at-a-glance, any information provided should be brief, easy to understand, and clearly describe the benefit or action needed.**

    * **3rd level = More details, technical information & granular controls** \
One can safely assume that if a user actively digs for more information, then they really want to know the details. So give them all the details, but without alienating (or worrying) non-technical users.

* **Make it absolutely clear when to take action, and how.** Clearly differentiate between FYI things and things that require urgent action. For example…

    * **If there is an actual, immediate problem,**

      * Use red and/or negative icons.

      * ALWAYS provide an actionable way to resolve the issue. After all, if the app could make a decision by itself, there would be no need to display a message or error!

    * **If there _could_ be a problem,** even theoretically,

      * Use neutral colours and icons.

      * For things that _can’t_ be acted upon, at least provide a link to learn more technical details and/or educational content wherever possible.

      * For things that _can_ be acted upon, provide a way to take action without alarming the user or making them feel like they _have_ to do something.

## UI content should…

* **Be written in plain language that anyone can understand.**

    * 1st and 2nd level content especially should pass the “my parents would understand this” test.

    * 3rd level content should at least be understandable at a high-level to any user.
    
    * Use as few words as possible to describe the “bottom line”.

    * Content that requires more explanation should be scannable:

      * Headlines/categories/labels should be able to stand on its own

      * Supporting copy should be brief and focus on the primary benefit or action needed

      * CTAs should be be proportionate to the importance/urgency of possible actions

    * Whenever writing content, the [Flesch–Kincaid scale](https://readable.com/readability/flesch-reading-ease-flesch-kincaid-grade-level/) is a good place to start, with Grade 5 as the benchmark.

      * **Pro tip:** Check out [this tool](https://hemingwayapp.com/) to see the reading age of whatever you’re writing

    * When it comes to translations, ALWAYS ask a native speaker to translate the content instead of relying on Google Translate :)

* **Avoid getting in the way of user generated content.**

    * Don’t decorate messages with erroneous or repetitive information.

    * Consider the size of text content in relation to the overall interface or timeline content.
