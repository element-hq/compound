Compound favours consistent iconography cross-platform. We use:

- Custom icons, drawn by ourselves on the [Material 24dp icon grid and keyline template](https://m3.material.io/styles/icons/designing-icons#8754553f-29d9-4671-b163-123b8e7b8f1e)
- [Material UI Rounded](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.style=Rounded) as a fallback icon set


### Contributing an icon

- Optimise for personal velocity while ideating, by using icons from the previous team library, our copy of the Material UI Rounded icon set in our shared workspace, or by drawing and creating new components locally in your Figma document
- Once you're confident in your design and the use of an icon, paste it in the [Compound - Icon drafting]() Figma document, following the guidelines.
- Then, once the icon is a part of the shared team library in Figma we'll let you know when the icon or icons are integrated. Then:
    - You can swap replace icon instances in your designs with the newly formed ones in the shared Compound team library.
    - You can trust they're available consistently and reliably on all platforms when used in development.
    out the component in your designs. Initially, we may need to collaborate on component composition to balance how we're using spacing all round. 

While this produces some short term overhead, it'll pay dividends. We'll use the learnings from integrating the first icons this way to formalise guidelines which will enable anyone to contribute directly.
